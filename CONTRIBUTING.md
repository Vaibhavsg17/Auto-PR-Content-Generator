## What We Are Looking For
We are looking for a variety of contributions, including but not limited to:
- Bug reports
- Bug fixes
- Feature requests
- Feature implementations
- Documentation improvements
- Code refactoring and optimization

## Getting Started

Before you begin:

- Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  - Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  - Make sure to mention the earliest version that you know has the issue.
- Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

1. **Create a Topic Branch**
   - Create a branch in your forked repository where you can create your changes.
   - Keep your branch focused on solving a single problem. This will make it easier to review and merge.

2. **Make Commits**
   - Make commits of logical units.
   - Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
   - Write meaningful commit messages.

3. **Write and Run Tests**
   - If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we encourage you to add tests!
   - Ensure the test suite passes after your changes.

4. **Write Documentation**
   - Aim to contribute usage examples to a separate directory, or provide them in the commit message if appropriate.
   - Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface or new environment variables.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
   - Submit a pull request to the original repository.
   - Clearly describe the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
   - Before submitting, please rebase your commits into a small number of coherent commits.

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug, please include as much information as possible about your platform, the version of the tool you are using, and relevant dependencies. Pasting in small code examples or linking to a repository with a larger example will help us understand and fix the issue faster.

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests but take them with a grain of caution â€” this project is designed to be lightweight and useful to as many people as possible. Feature requests that align with this philosophy will be considered more favorably.

## Code Review Process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given, we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks, we may close the PR if it isn't showing any activity.

## Community

We want a welcoming and vibrant community. We ask that you follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all your interactions within this project.

## License

By contributing to Auto PR Content Generator, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
